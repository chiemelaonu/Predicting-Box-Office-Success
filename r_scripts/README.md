## Overview
This is a folder for the R scripts used in my final project 

## R-scripts
- `1_inital_setup.R`: R script that holds the initial loading in of data, a quick EDA, target variable analysis, and the log transformation of the target variable.
- `1_inital_split.R`: holds the initial splitting of the log transformed data (`survival_time_log10`).
