## Data source

[Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashpalsingh1525/imdb-movies-dataset/data)
Data was sourced from Kaggle.com, a site hosting thousands of datasets for the public to use. Accessed January 31st 2025


## Prediction Problem
The goal of this study is to predict pancreatic cancer survival based on demographic, lifestyle, and medical history variables. This is a binary regressions problem, where the target variable is `Survival_Time_Months`.
<br>  
Pancreatic cancer has one of the lowest survival rates among cancers, so being able to predict survival outcomes could be really useful. A good prediction model could help doctors identify high-risk patients earlier and plan treatments accordingly. It could also provide insight into what factors influence survival the most.  


## Data Quality Check


The data has 24 variables, with 50,000 observations. It has 9 categorical variables, and 15 numerical variables.


```{r}
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Dataset Summary"
#| echo: false


## calculate values
missing_rows <- sum(!complete.cases(movies))
num_rows <- nrow(movies)
num_cols <- ncol(movies)

# create a table
summary <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("Rows with Missing Values", "Number of Observations", "Number of Variables"),
  Value = c(missing_rows, num_rows, num_cols)
)

# display as a table
summary_table <- knitr::kable(summary, caption = "Dataset Summary")

summary_table

```
There is no missingness in the data and the data does appear to be tidy.

### Variable Types 

```{r}
#| label: variable-types
#| echo: false

# count variable types
variable_types <- sapply(movies, class)

# summarize counts
num_numerical <- sum(variable_types %in% c("integer", "numeric"))
num_categorical <- sum(variable_types %in% c("factor", "character"))

# print results
cat("Numerical Variables:", num_numerical, "\n")
cat("Categorical Variables:", num_categorical, "\n")
```



## Target Variable Analysis

![Survival_Time_Months Transformed to log 10 Scale](figures/graphic_2.png){#fig-profit-log10}

Inspecting target distribution `Survival_Time_Months` on original scale and on a log 10 transformation scale.

```{r}
#| label: missingness-check
#| tbl-cap: "Target Variable Check"
#| echo: false

  select(revenue) |>
  skimr::skim_without_charts() |>
  knitr::kable()
```
The target variable is originally skewed right. Seeing this, a log transformation is helpful because it makes the distribution more symmetrical.
Symmetrical distributions are balanced around the mean, so the model doesn't get influenced by outliers or skewed data.
